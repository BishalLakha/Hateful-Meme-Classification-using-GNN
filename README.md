# Hateful Meme Detection Using GNN
### To-Do

- [x] Remove text from all memes
- [x] Generate Caption for all memes
- [x] Generate image embeddings
- [x] Train a GNN text classifier
- [x] Train GNN Classifier in meme data
- [x] Create text based multimodal GNN
- [x] Create both text and image based multimodal GNN
- [ ] Use word-to-vec embedding
- [ ] Use clip-bert embeddings
- [ ] Train the model on different dataset



#### Issues

- [ ] Performance doesn't improve by the use of image embeddings



Possible Solutions:

1. Instead of learning word embeddings, use pre-trained word embeddings
2. Use clip-bert embeddings for image representation of words
3. Train the heterogeneous graph with different class of node having different feature type and length
